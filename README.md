TASK1: MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

Description: Build a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies to users based on their preferences.

Steps:

- Data Collection: Gather movie ratings data from users, including movie IDs, user IDs, and ratings.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform exploratory data analysis.
- User-Item Matrix: Create a user-item matrix where rows represent users, columns represent movies, and entries represent ratings.
- Collaborative Filtering: Implement collaborative filtering algorithms like User-Based or Item-Based methods.
- Model Evaluation: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the recommendation system's accuracy.
- Top-N Recommendations: Generate top-N movie recommendations for a specific user.
- Interactive Interface: Create a simple web interface to allow users to input their preferences and receive movie recommendations.
- Tech Stack:

Python
- Data manipulation libraries (pandas)
- Recommendation libraries (surprise)
- Web framework (Flask or Django) for creating the interface

TASK2: FRAUD DETECTION IN FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS

Description: Develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in a financial dataset.

Steps:

- Data Collection: Obtain historical transaction data, including features like transaction amount, timestamp, etc.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and balance the dataset if needed.
- Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features and engineer new ones that could aid in fraud detection.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize patterns and anomalies in the data using graphs and statistics.
- Model Selection: Choose classification algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks.
- Model Training: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Tech Stack:

Python
- Data manipulation libraries 
- Machine learning libraries 
- Deep learning libraries
